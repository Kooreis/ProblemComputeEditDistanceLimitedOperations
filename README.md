# Question: How do you compute the edit distance between two words with limited operations allowed? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript function `minDistance` calculates the minimum number of operations needed to transform one word into another, also known as the edit distance. The function takes two words as input and uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It first initializes a two-dimensional array, `dp`, with dimensions based on the lengths of the input words. The array is filled such that `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of operations required to convert the first `i` characters of `word1` into the first `j` characters of `word2`. The function then iterates over the characters in the words, comparing them and updating the `dp` array based on whether the characters are the same or different. If the characters are the same, no operation is needed, so `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i-1][j-1]`. If the characters are different, an operation is needed, so `dp[i][j]` is set to the minimum of `dp[i-1][j-1]`, `dp[i-1][j]`, and `dp[i][j-1]` plus one. The function finally returns `dp[len1][len2]`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to transform `word1` into `word2`.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is very similar to the JavaScript version. Both versions use the same logic and algorithm to solve the problem. The main difference is that the TypeScript version includes type annotations, which are not present in the JavaScript version.

In the TypeScript version, the function `minDistance` has its parameters `word1` and `word2` annotated as `string`, and the return type of the function is annotated as `number`. This provides additional type safety, ensuring that the function can only be called with string arguments and will always return a number.

The TypeScript version also uses `let` for variable declaration instead of `var` used in the JavaScript version. `let` has block scope which makes it a better choice than `var` which has function scope.

The TypeScript version also uses a more modern and concise way to create and initialize the 2D array `dp`. It uses `Array(m + 1).fill(0).map(() => Array(n + 1).fill(0))` to create a 2D array with all elements initialized to 0, whereas the JavaScript version uses a nested for loop to achieve the same result.

Other than these differences, the two versions are essentially the same. Both versions use dynamic programming to compute the minimum edit distance between two words, and the core logic of the algorithm is identical in both versions.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses the same dynamic programming approach as the JavaScript version to solve the problem. Both versions create a 2D array (dp) where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to convert word1[0..i-1] to word2[0..j-1]. The final result is stored in dp[len1][len2] in JavaScript and dp[m][n] in C++.

However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used in the two versions:

1. Array Initialization: In JavaScript, arrays are initialized using the new Array() constructor and then each sub-array is initialized in a loop. In C++, the 2D vector (analogous to a 2D array) is initialized in a single line using the vector constructor that takes the size and initial value as arguments.

2. Minimum Function: JavaScript uses the built-in Math.min() function to find the minimum of three values. In C++, there is no built-in function to find the minimum of three values, so a custom min() function is defined using the std::min() function which can only find the minimum of two values.

3. String Length: JavaScript uses the length property to get the length of a string. C++ uses the length() member function to get the length of a string.

4. User Input: The JavaScript version hard-codes the input strings, while the C++ version prompts the user to enter the input strings at runtime using std::cin.

5. Output: JavaScript uses console.log() to print the result, while C++ uses std::cout.

6. Loop Structure: The JavaScript version uses separate loops to initialize the first row and column of the dp array, while the C++ version does this within the main loop by checking if i or j is 0.

7. String Character Access: JavaScript uses the charAt() method to access a character in a string, while C++ uses array-like indexing.
